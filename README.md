# \*Purr*
This bot was made to use the [nekos.life]-API.  
What started as a simple and easy bot became quite a big bot, that is now even on the official Discord of Nekos.life!

# Inviting the bot
The bot has two invite-links: A full invite and a basic invite.

## Full invite
The link for the full invite gives \*Purr* all permissions, to work properly and without any issues.
The permissions include:
* Managing messages: Will be used to delete certain commands of users like `.invite` or `.info`
* Adding reactions: Nothing really special. Just makes \*Purr*'s responses a bit different.
* Attach files: Used for the welcome-channel (`.welcome`), to create a image for the joined user.
* Use of external emojis: For using external (custom) emojis.
* All permissions of the basic invite.

## Basic invite
The basic invite will only give the most necessary permissions for \*Purr* to work correctly.
This permissions are:
* See messages: Let \*Purr* see all channels, that don't have channel-specific permissions.
* Send messages: Let her send messages.
* Embed Links: \*Purr* won't work without this permission!

# Voting
\*Purr* has a integrated Votelistener that gives you a reward (currently just a role) on the [Discord].  
Just make sure to be on the guild and vote for the bot, to receive the special role.  
Future rewards may be added.
